What is "Steps"?
‚ùì Steps is a programming language made specifically to run on Virtel. As have been said before, Steps also lacks lots of functionality, but is constantly improved - creating programs in Steps isn't that far away from reality. The file extension that Steps uses is pretty straightforward: .steps. The same thing can be said about the language itself, as the syntax is pretty easy to learn. If you don't like Steps, in the near future you will be able to write code via another language that compiles into Steps.

	üî¨ In the future, there will be a dedicated Steps documentation, where you will be able to read and see lots of examples. This section exists only for the sole purpose of providing some basic information about the Steps language, as the documentation hasn't been written yet.

    Different code examples:
Basic example, working with bin run:
start.steps is always a starting point for any Steps application. In this example we also jump to the run.steps file.

Path of the file (may depend on the system): C:/Virtel/apps/vladceresna.virtel.launcher/bin/start.steps

Script in start.steps:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">
var set greet "Hello!";
csl write greet;
var set greet "Hi!";
csl write greet;
var del greet;
csl write greet;
bin run run.steps;
</div>
Script in run.steps:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">
sys out "Hello from run";
sys out "This is run";
</div>
Another example, working with math commmands:
This example briefly shows how you can use mathematics in Steps.

Steps Code:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">
var set a 5;
var set b 5;
mat plus a b c;
csl write c;
</div>
Output of the code:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">

Here's another mathematical example showing the root command:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">
mat root "27" "3" c;
sys out c;
</div>
Outputs:
<div class="my-5 whitespace-break-spaces rounded-2xl border bg-stone-200 px-3 py-2 font-mono dark:bg-stone-800">
