	‚ùì Virtel is the fastest, the most secure and safe crossplatform customized virtual enviroment. Best suited for
	mathematical calculations, development or deployment of applications and servers, though can be
	used for any purpose. We call it the <b>operating system</b>.
</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
	üéØ What is the point of Virtel? Our goal is pretty simple: instead of writing software for
	different platforms separately or adding compatibility with other OS(es) later, we want people to
	write programs via <b>Virtel</b> - this <b>allows your code to run on practically any machine</b>,
	as Virtel is specifically made to be compatible with most platforms.
</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
	And Virtel is our way to Web 3.0 and decentralized systems. And then security and confidence of private users data.
